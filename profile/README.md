# Whisper Security

**See the Internet in God Mode**

Whisper is revolutionizing cybersecurity by shifting from reactive defense to predictive intelligence. We empower organizations to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks before they cause damage.

## About Whisper

Whisper provides next-generation, real-time threat intelligence powered by a proprietary knowledge graph that maps over **45 billion interconnected data points** across domains, IPs, ASNs, BGP routing, DNS resolution, and more.

Our platform transcends traditional threat intelligence by:
- **Predicting attacks earlier** - Detect threats before they materialize
- **Cutting false positives** - Advanced graph algorithms deliver exceptional accuracy
- **Understanding threat contexts** - Uncover hidden connections between malicious assets
- **Enabling real-time response** - Live internet infrastructure intelligence

### Why Whisper?

Traditional cybersecurity tools are reactive, siloed, and slow to update, leaving organizations blind to emerging threats. As AI-driven and multi-vector attacks accelerate, Whisper delivers:

- **20x more data points** than traditional threat intelligence platforms
- **6x more source types** including live routing, registration, and resolution data
- **Real-time recency** with continuous infrastructure analysis
- **Predictive capabilities** leveraging advanced graph algorithms and theoretical physics-based scoring models

## Use Cases

### For Cybersecurity Providers
Integrate our APIs to deliver faster, more accurate threat prediction to your customers with plug-and-play solutions that boost automated security operations.

### For Government & Defense
Detect coordinated threats, malicious networks, and digital espionage with real-time visibility into where traffic originates and national security implications.

### For Enterprises
Continuously predict threats and correlate internet infrastructure to mitigate complex, multi-vector cyber risks at scale.

## About Us

Whisper was founded in January 2025 byKaveh Ranjbar (former CIO of RIPE NCC, ICANN board member) and Soroush Rafiee Rad (PhD in Mathematics & Complex Systems).

We emerged from Antler's fall 2024 program as one of just 0.41% of 8,000 startups selected for funding, and raised €1.6M in pre-seed capital to build predictive cybersecurity at scale.
